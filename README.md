BACKEND

backend initialized with npm init -y

npm i bcryptjs cors dotenv express jsonwebtoken

.gitignore created in backend to ignore node_modules and .env

created server folder
added .env and index.js

FRONTEND

frontend project started with npm create vite@latest .

after npm install to install react, these npm packages were also added:

npm i @uidotdev/usehooks sass jwt-decode react-icons react-router-dom react-toastify

I removed the redundant ',' from main.jsx, that is there when creating the Vite project.

I added justify-content: center to body in index.css to center content
